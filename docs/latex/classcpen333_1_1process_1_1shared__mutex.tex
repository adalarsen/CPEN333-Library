An inter-\/process mutual exclusion synchronization primitive allowing for shared access.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$shared\+\_\+mutex.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
An inter-\/process mutual exclusion synchronization primitive allowing for shared access. 

Used to protect access to a resource shared by multiple processes, allowing shared `read\textquotesingle{} access, mirroring std\+::shared\+\_\+mutex in c++17. This is an alias to \hyperlink{classcpen333_1_1process_1_1impl_1_1shared__mutex__fair}{cpen333\+::process\+::impl\+::shared\+\_\+mutex\+\_\+fair}.
