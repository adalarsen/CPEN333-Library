\hypertarget{index_sec_intro}{}\section{Introduction}\label{index_sec_intro}
This library is designed to simplify usage of many of the inter-\/thread and inter-\/process synchronization and communication mechanisms taught in the C\+P\+E\+N333 course at U\+BC. It consists mainly of a collection of classes that wrap around platform-\/specific code, providing a uniform interface.\hypertarget{index_sec_usage}{}\section{Usage}\label{index_sec_usage}
This is a header-\/only library, meaning that no compilation is required. Simply put the root {\ttfamily cpen333} folder in a known location, and add its path to the set of include directories. On {\ttfamily gcc}, this can be accomplished by adding the {\ttfamily -\/I$<$path to cpen333$>$} directive.
